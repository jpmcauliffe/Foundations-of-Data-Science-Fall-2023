    "_The model above demonstrates that, while quite unlikely, it is certainly possible for 8/13 cards drawn to have been face cards purely by chance. It appears that around 2% of the time, 8 or more of the 13 cards drawn will be face cards due to chance alone. With the information presented in the model above, it is safe to believe that your resounding loss in the first round of the game is due to your bad luck, and not due to a rigged deck of cards._\n",
