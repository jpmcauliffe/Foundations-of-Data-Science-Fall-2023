Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a pracitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answered correctly.\n",

Here, since larger values of the test statistic suggest the alternative model (where the chance of guessing the correct hand is something other than 50%), we can formalize our analysis by finding what proportion of simulated statistics were as large or larger than our observed test statistic (the area at or to the right of the observed test statistic). If this area is small enough, we’ll declare that the observed data are inconsistent with our simulated model.
